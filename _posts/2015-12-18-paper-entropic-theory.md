[Guillaume](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~carlier/), [Vincent](https://who.rocq.inria.fr/Vincent.Duval/), [Bernhard](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~schmitzer/) and myself just released [a preprint "Convergence of Entropic Schemes for Optimal Transport and Gradient Flows"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02783), that lays the theoretical foundations of the approximation by entropic regularization of various optimal-transport related problems, such as (with links to relevant papers):

- [The computation of the transport plan](http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0895),
- [The computation of barycenters](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01096124),
- [The computation of gradient flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06216).

We proved the convergence toward the usual optimal transport solution as the regularization vanishes and (for the flows) the step size decays toward zero in a suitable way. The difficulty is to handle the fixed marginal constraint and to cope with the extra diffusivity created by the entropic regularization.
