[Antonin](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~antonin/), [Vincent](https://who.rocq.inria.fr/Vincent.Duval/), [Clarice](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/cmhsp2/) and myself just released [the preprint "Geometric properties of solutions to the total variation denoising problem"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00087). We revisit the classical Total Variation (TV) [image denoising method](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016727899290242F) of Rudin, [Osher](http://www.math.ucla.edu/~sjo/) and Fatemi, from a  theoretical perspective. We try to lay some a firm theoretical ground to study the ability (or the inability ...) of TV to restore sharp edges.
