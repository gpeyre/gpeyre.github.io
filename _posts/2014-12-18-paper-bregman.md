[Jean-David Benamou](https://who.rocq.inria.fr/Jean-David.Benamou/), [Guillaume Carlier](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~carlier/), [Marco Cuturi](http://www.iip.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/member/cuturi/), [Luca Nenna](https://who.rocq.inria.fr/Luca.Nenna/) and [myself](http://gpeyre.github.io/) just released [a new paper](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01096124) on the use of Bregman iterative projections to solve a large variety of optimal transport related problems. The underlying schemes are deceptively simple, and in particular, it gives a very simple (yet state of the art) method to compute approximate Wasserstein barycenters. The code is also [available online](https://github.com/gpeyre/2014-SISC-BregmanOT). You can also have a look at this [Numerical Tour](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/gpeyre/numerical-tours/blob/master/matlab/optimaltransp_5_entropic.ipynb) for a simple illustration of the method to the classical optimal transport problem.
