Jean-David Benamou, Guillaume Carlier, Marco Cuturi, Luca Nenna and myself just released [a new paper](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01096124) on the use of iterative Bregman iterative projections to solve a large variety of optimal transport related problems. The underlying scheme are deceptively simple, and in particular, it gives a very simple (yet state of the art) method to compute approximate Wasserstein barycenters. The code is also [available online](https://github.com/gpeyre/2014-SISC-BregmanOT).
