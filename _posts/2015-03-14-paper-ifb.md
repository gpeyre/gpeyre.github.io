[Jingwei Liang](https://www.greyc.fr/users/jliang), [Jalal Fadili](https://fadili.users.greyc.fr/),  and [myself](http://gpeyre.github.io/) just released [a new paper](http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_HTML/2015/03/4817.html) on the convergence and finite time model identification of a general class of Forward-Backward (FB) algorithms that makes use of an inertial step. This class includes in particular the FISTA algorithm. This works thus generalizes our [NIPS paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.5611). The basics of the FB algorithm can be found in this [numerical tour](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/gpeyre/numerical-tours/blob/master/matlab/optim_4_fb.ipynb).
