We just released two new papers related to imaging for neurosciences, accepted for publication in [Joural of Neuroscience Methods](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-neuroscience-methods/). The first one, [An automated workflow for the anatomo-functional mapping of the barrel cortex](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01196436) deals with registration and reconstruction of the barrel cortex from anatomical slices. The second one, [Spatially Structured Sparse Morphological Component Separation for Voltage-Sensitive Dye Optical Imaging](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01200646) deals with sources separation in optical imaging using sparse regularization and convex optimization.
