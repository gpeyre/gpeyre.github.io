A set of 20 new [Numerical Tours](www.numerical-tours.com/python/) in Python has just been released. It consists in all the most important Numerical Tours, and covers all the topics, from Wavelet image denoising to 3D mesh parameterization. [Enjoy!](www.numerical-tours.com/python/)

This conversion has been funded by the ERC project [SIGMA-Vision](gpeyre.github.io/sigma-vision/), and it has been performed by [Pierre Stock](https://github.com/pierrestock), congratulation for this nice work!
