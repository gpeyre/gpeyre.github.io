Together with my co-authors [Marco Cuturi](http://www.iip.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/member/cuturi/) and [Justin Solomon](people.csail.mit.edu/jsolomon/), we released our [ICML'16](icml.cc/2016/) paper [Gromov-Wasserstein Averaging of Kernel and Distance Matrices](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01322992). This paper makes use of the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance between metric spaces we used in our [SIGGRAPH'16 paper](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01305808) in order to compute average (barycenter) of similarity matrices (typically pairwise distance matrices or SDP kernels). The key ingredient are nice closed form formula to update the GW cost matrix using matrix-multiplication and  to update the barycenter. The resulting scheme is attractive because it does not require to actually pre-register the matrices.
