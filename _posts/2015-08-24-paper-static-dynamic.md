Together with [Lenaic Chizat](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~chizat/), [François-Xavier Vialard](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~vialard/) and [Bernhard Schmitzer](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~schmitzer/), we released our paper ["Unbalanced Optimal Transport: Geometry and Kantorovich Formulation"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.05216). It is somehow a sequel to [our previous work](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06430) on the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao (WFR) distance. The first part of the paper is dedicated to the study of the geometry of this distance between un-normalized measures (i.e. they are not restricted to have unit mass). The second part derives a new class of "static" formulations of unbalanced optimal transportation distances. The novelty, that I find quite nice, is the introduction of *two* couplings (instead of a single one for traditional optimal transport) to account for both transport and creation/destruction of mass.
