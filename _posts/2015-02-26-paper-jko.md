I just released a new paper entitled [Entropic Wasserstein Gradient Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06216). It makes use of the same entropy regularization strategy we have used previously for [various optimal transport related problems](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01096124), but now it is to compute gradient flows according to the Wassertein distance. This means that it is used to minimize a functional, but instead of defining the gradient with respect to the usual topology, it is defined according to the Wasserstein distance. For instance, when minimizing the entropy, one gets a linear diffusion equation. One can also handle non-smooth functionals such as box constraint to enforce congestion constraint to model crowd motion. The [slides of the talks are](https://speakerdeck.com/gpeyre/discrete-entropic-wasserstein-flows) available, and also [the source code](https://github.com/gpeyre/2015-SIIMS-wasserstein-jko).
